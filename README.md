# Note Taker Application
  ## Description
  The goal of this project was to setup a server that can handle GET, POST, and DELETE requests based on the following routes: *, /note, /api/notes, /api/notes:id. I used a JSON file to store the notes with a unique id generated using the uuid helper function. The technology we used for this assignment was node.js, express.js, and heroku. For more information on the assignment you can find the details [here](./assets/AssignmentDetails.md).
